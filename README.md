# Simple Bottle Sorting Game

- This project was a spontanous idea
- at the same day, I developed the base idea in around 2-3 hours without tools as ChatGPT
- on the second day, I just went for a few simple bug-fixes and came around with a simple design
- the project is written in React with Typescript and Next
